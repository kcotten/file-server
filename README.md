# file-server
UCSC Project FTP file server using HTTP

This project includes an http based file server created and stubbed out by Professor Harrison and completed by Kris Cotten for a computer security course.

The companion repo, password-cracker, includes a brute force password cracker and an automated way of executing a function on the file server with a NOP sled.
